So in this experiment I wanted to see if you can remove a status effect through another status effect.
The project was originally intended to allow monsters to cause a long drawn out "bleeding" status effect which is removed by applying a bandage.

Though other thoughts have come to mind such as environmental hazards applying diseases and various illnesses that requires you to find various treatments in order to cure. Giving more purpose to farming and hunting creatures.
