In this experiment I wanted to see how much particles can be modified
Though I am focusing on dripping particles - the concept applies to all.

Initial and Final Velocity of the particle determine the direction and velocity of the particle 
Approach seems to be a standard deviation 
Currently it doesn't seem particles are affected by world physics. Nor can you apply physics to the particle.

I think I am going to overhaul how temperature is done.
Right now I don't feel it fits well with the game in the fact it simply "slows" you down or "speeds you up"
