In this experiment I wanted to know if I could make a plant be placed only if certain conditions are met.
In reality I wanted to be able to have much more conditions but it seems I would have to rewrite the entire farming mechanic.

So instead all this does is make the reefpod check if it is under water. If it isn't, or later on becomes above water it dies.
So make sure you always maintain your water levels!

The problem with this method though is its over simplistic nature would allow you to exploit it by creating a block with water above. So it doesn't have to be under water it just needs to actually have water 4 blocks above it. So bare in mind - if you want more advanced checking you will need to add in more code.
